	<h2>The RETURN Project</h2>
	<p>I am excited to begin working with KU's Center for Digital Inclusion on the RETURN project. This program is 
	designed to aid women who have been involved with the criminal justice system build computer literacy skills.

	<h2>Software and data carpentry workshops</h2>
	<p>Only about 25% of jobs in computing, software development, and coding are held by women. As I develop my own coding skills, one of my priorities is to make it easier for other women to join these spaces as well. 
		In June of 2022, I will begin training to lead software and data carpentries through The Carpentries - a nonprofit whose mission is to provide
		practical coding and data skills to researchers worldwide. As an instructor in this field, I hope to make coding feel more accessible to women and other minorities.</br></p>
