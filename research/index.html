	<p>While my academic upbringing comes from the world of paleobotany, I am interested more broadly in 
		how we can utilize modern tools to better understand plant evolution on a macroevolutionary scale, 
		specifically relating to the plant form. My work focuses on extinct & extant seed-free vascular plant morphology, anatomy, and evolution.</p></div>

<div align="left"><h2><font color="2A4906">Cyathealean ferns</font></h2></div>
	<p>The Cyatheales, colloquially known as tree ferns, are found today in tropical to temperate regions worldwide. 
		Modern molecular classification of the order includes eight families containing 13 genera and 713 species. 
		Cyathealean ferns may date back as early as the Triassic, and become prominent components of floras later in the Mesozoic. 
		Despite their plentifulness in the fossil record, identifying these fossils poses many challenges. 
		Molecular classifications of this order based on extant members, in many cases, lack strong morphological synapomorphies. 
		In addition, the morphology of single organs of the Cyatheales can often resemble those of distantly related ferns. 
		These difficulties, coupled with inconsistent classification and frequent movement of fossil and living ferns on several taxonomic levels, has resulted in an inordinately complicated taxonomic history of the Cyatheales. 
		In addition to describing a new fossil fern specimen, I hope this work can highlight the 
		importance of considering morphological data in the phylogenetic analysis of ferns, stress the importance of standards in qualitative 
		morphological description, and illustrate the value in classical morphological and anatomical study of plants.

	<p>Devonian floras illustrate the earliest radiations of vascular plant diversity, and allow paleobotanists a unique appreciation for how these morphologically simple plants laid the groundwork
		for the immense variation in plant form since. One group of these plants, the zosterophylls, are the earliest members of the lycophytes. Members of this clade dominated Carboniferous landscapes,
		and persist today. Despite their pivotal systematic position relative to both the lycophytes and euphyllophytes, relationships within the group as well as with other Devonian plants remain murky. 
		For the completion of my master's thesis, I built a matrix of taxa with a focus on anatomical characters, aiming to evaluate relationships within the group.
		The results of this project emphasized the importance of how utilizing both anatomical and morphological characters,
		especially with morphologically 'simple' plants, to render the most accurate representation of their relationships.</p>

	<p>Further directions for this research are (1) to more thoroughly investigate zosterophyll relationships with other groups of early vascular plants
		and (2) utilize this robust matrix as a portion of a much larger morphology- and anatomy-based phylogenetic analysis of lycophytes.</p>
