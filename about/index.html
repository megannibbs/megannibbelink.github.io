	<h1>About me</h1>
	<h2>Academic biography</h2>
	<p>My passion for plant evolution was realized my second year of college when I took the Evolutionary Morphology of Vascular Plants, taught by my undergraduate and 
		Master's advisor, Dr. Mihai Tomescu. While the content by no means came to me easily, I was enchanted by the story narrated by the various plant forms
		of the last 400 million years. This class inspired a barrage of questions about plant evolution (some of which I find myself still wondering about today), 
		and served as the catalyst for my desire to pursue a career in science. As a Master's student, I was able to pursue my interest in systematics, culminating in a morphology-based project
		soon to be published in the Francis Heuber edition of the International Journal of Plant Sciences in the Summer of 2022. As I move into a new season of my academic career, I am looking to 
		continue classical morphology and anatomy studies of both fossil and living plants, as well as move some of my work into sytematic theory as it pertains to morphology-based systematic analysis. I am a very proud alumnus of the Tomescu Lab at Humboldt State University (now Cal Poly Humboldt) 
		and current member of the Matsunaga Lab at the University of Kansas.</br>
		I discovered how much I enjoyed teaching early in my academic career. As an undergraduate student, I worked as a tutor in many subjects and as a supplemental instruction leader for general botany.
		Since then, I have enjoyed working as a teaching assistant at HSU as well as at KU and seen my students go on to start careers in industry, go to grad school, and recieve numerous awards and scholarships. Aside from my current position as a teaching assistant, I am looking forward to expanding my teaching into my forthcoming involvement in The Carpentries and The RETURN Project at KU 
		to teach coding, data skills, and computer literacy.</p>
	<p>Outside of my work, I enjoy trying new beers with my friends and spending time with my pets - Darwin (dog) and Hank (rabbit).</p>
	<h2>Philosophy</h2>
	<p><div align="center">"I am more and more convinced that our happiness or unhappiness depends far more on the way we meet the events of life than on the nature of those events themselves."</br>
	-Alexander von Humboldt</div></p>
	<p>As a researcher, I aim to contribute to society's understanding of evolution, but simultaneously believe that pursuing the answers to questions purely for the sake of knowledge is a worthy cause and try to foster both of these tenants in my work. 
		In teaching, I see my role as that of a coach. I believe that teaching students how to learn and think critically is equally as important as the curriculum of their coursework. While my drive to pursue academia is primarily rooted in my love for both research and teaching, I am also driven by a strong sense of justice - 
		that all people deserve an opportunity to pursue knowledge. I aim to utilize my voice, in my current and future positions, to advocate for this access. </p>
