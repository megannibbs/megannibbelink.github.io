	<h1>About me</h1>
	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>My passion for plant evolution was realized my second year of college when I took the Evolutionary Morphology of Vascular Plants, taught by my undergraduate and 
		Master's advisor, Dr. Mihai Tomescu. While the content by no means came to me easily, I was enchanted by the story narrated by the various plant forms
		of the last 400 million years. This class inspired a barrage of questions about plant evolution (some of which I find myself still wondering about today), 
		and serves as the catalyst for my desire to pursue a career in science. I am a very proud alumnus of the Tomescu Lab at Humboldt State University (now Cal Poly Humboldt) and current
		member of the Matsunaga Lab at the University of Kansas. 
		
	<h2>My philosophy</h2>
	<p>While my drive to pursue academia is primarily rooted in my love for both research and teaching, I am also driven by a strong sense of justice - 
		that all people deserve an opportunity to pursue knowledge. I aim to utilize my voice, in my current and future positions, to advocate for this access.</br>
		</br>
		Outside of my work, I enjoy trying new beers with my friends and spending time with my pets - Darwin (dog) and Hank (rabbit).</p>
