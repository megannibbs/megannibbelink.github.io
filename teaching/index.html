	<h2>The Carpentries</h2>
	<p>Only 10-25% of professional positions in computing, software development, and bioinformatics are held by women. 
		As I develop my own coding skills, one of my priorities is to make it easier for other women to exist in these spaces as well. 
		In June of 2022, I will begin training to lead software and data carpentries workshops through The Carpentries - a nonprofit whose mission is to provide
		practical coding and data skills to researchers worldwide. 
		As an instructor in this field, I hope to create a space that makes coding feel more accessible to women and other minorities.</br></p>

<h2>The RETURN Project</h2>
	<p>I am excited to begin working with KU's Center for Digital Inclusion on the RETURN project. This program is 
	designed to aid women who have previously been involved with the justice system build computer literacy skills.
