	<h1>Teaching</h1>
	<p>In addition to my experience as a tutor, supplemental instruction leader, and teaching assistant, 
		I have recently begun to pursue additional opportunities at KU to expand my teaching repertoire.</p> 
	<h2><font color="2A4906">The Carpentries</font></h2>
	<p>Only 10-25% of professional positions in computing, software development, and bioinformatics are held by women. 
		As I develop my own coding skills, one of my priorities is to make it easier for other women to exist in these spaces as well. 
		I am currently finishing up my training to be an instructor for software and data carpentries workshops through The Carpentries - a nonprofit whose mission is to provide
		practical coding and data skills to researchers worldwide. 
		As an instructor in this field, I hope to create a space that makes coding feel more accessible to women.</br></p>

	<h2><font color="2A4906">The RETURN Project</font></h2>
	<p>I am excited to begin working with KU's Center for Digital Inclusion on the RETURN project. In this role, I am currently working to develop the program's first introductory coding curriculum. This program is 
	designed to aid women who have previously been involved with the justice system build computer literacy skills.
