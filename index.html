	<h1>Hi there, I'm Megan Nibbelink!</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Kansas. 
		My research interests include paleobotany, plant morphology & anatomy, systematic theory, 
		and computational biology as they relate to living and extinct ferns and lycophytes. <a 

	<p>Aside from my research, I am an avid supporter of equity and accessibility in education. 
		I have recently begin working with KU's Center for Digital Inclusion on a project to help women who have been involved with the justice system 
		build computer literacy skills. <a href="/return">Read more about the RETURN Project here...</a></p>
