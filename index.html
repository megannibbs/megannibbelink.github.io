	<p>My research interests include paleobotany, plant morphology & anatomy, systematic theory, 
		and computational biology as they relate to living and extinct ferns and lycophytes.</p>
	<p>Aside from my research, I am a passionate advocate for equity and access in education. I am excited to begin working with 
		KU's Center for Digital Inclusion soon on a project that aims to help women who have been involved with the justice system 
		build computer literacy skills. <a href="/return">Read more about the RETURN Project here.</a></p>
	<p>I am currently working towards becoming a workshop instructor through The Carpentries, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to teach coding
		and data science skills to researchers.<a href="/return">Read more about The Carpentries here.</a></p></div>
