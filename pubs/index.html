	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>While my academic upbringing comes from the world of paleobotany, I am interested more broadly in 
		how we can utilize modern tools to better understand plant evolution on a macroevolutionary scale, 
		specifically relating to the plant form. My work focuses on extinct & extant seed-free vascular plants. </p>
	<h2>Zosterophyll systematics</h2>
	<div align="center"><img src="/images/ZostTrees.jpg" width="750px"/></div></br>
	<p>Devonian floras illustrate the earliest radiations of vascular plant diversity, and how these morphologically simple plants laid the groundwork
		for the variation we see today. One group of these plants, the zosterophylls, are considered the earliest members of the lycophyte clade. 
		Despite their pivotal systematic position, relationships within the group as well as those with other Devonian plants remain murky. 
		For the completion of my master's thesis, I built a matrix of taxa with preserved anatomy, aiming to evaluate relationships within the group.
		The focus on anatomy emphasized the importance of utilizing both anatomical and morphological characters to assess relationships,
		especially with morphologically 'simple' plants, to render the most accurate relationships.
		Further directions for this research are (1) to more thoroughly investigate zosterophyll relationships with other groups of early vascular plants
		and (2) utilize this robust matrix as a portion of a much larger morphology- and anatomy-based phylogenetic analysis of lycophytes.

	<h2>Fossil Cyatheales</h2>
	<p>The Cyatheales, colloquially known as tree ferns, are known today in tropical to temperate regions worldwide. Modern molecular classification of the order 
		includes eight families containing 13 genera and 713 species. Morphologically, these ferns are recognized as homosporous, leptosporangiate ferns 
		whose sporangia have oblique annuli.
