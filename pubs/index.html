	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>While my academic upbringing comes from the world of paleobotany, I am interested more broadly in 
		how we can utilize modern tools to better understand plant evolution on a macroevolutionary scale, 
		specifically relating to the plant form. My work focuses on extinct & extant seed-free vascular plants. </p>

	<div align="center"><img src="/images/ZostTrees.jpg" width="750px"/></div></br>
	<p>Devonian floras illustrate the earliest radiations of vascular plant diversity, and how these morphologically simple plants laid the groundwork
		for the variation we see today. One group of these plants, the zosterophylls, are considered the earliest members of the lycophyte clade. 
		Despite their pivotal systematic position, relationships within the group as well as their relationships with other Devonian plants remain murky. 
		For the completion of my master's thesis, I built a matrix of taxa with a focus on anatomical characters, aiming to evaluate relationships within the group.
		The results of this project emphasized the importance of utilizing both anatomical and morphological characters to assess relationships,
		especially with morphologically 'simple' plants, to render the most accurate relationships.<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/720384">You can read about it here.</a></p>
	<p>Further directions for this research are (1) to more thoroughly investigate zosterophyll relationships with other groups of early vascular plants
		and (2) utilize this robust matrix as a portion of a much larger morphology- and anatomy-based phylogenetic analysis of lycophytes.</p>
		
	<div align="center"><h2>Fossil Cyatheales</h2></div>
	<p>The Cyatheales, colloquially known as tree ferns, are known today in tropical to temperate regions worldwide. 
		Modern molecular classification of the order includes eight families containing 13 genera and 713 species. 
		Cyathealean ferns may date back as early as the Triassic, and become prominent components of floras by the Miocene. 
		Despite their plentifulness in the fossil record, identifying these fossils poses many challenges. 
		Molecular classifications of this order based on extant members, in many cases, lack strong morphological synapomorphies. 
		In addition, the morphology of single organs of the Cyatheales can often resemble those of distantly related ferns. 
		This combination of difficulties has resulted in sometimes inconsistent classification and subsequent movement of taxa between orders and 
		an inordinately complicated taxonomic history. In combination with describing a new fossil fern, I hope this work can highlight the 
		importance of considering morphological data in the phylogenetic analysis of ferns, stress the importance of standards in qualitative 
		morphological description, and illustrate the value in classical morphological and anatomical study of plants.
