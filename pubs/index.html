	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>While my academic upbringing comes from the world of paleobotany, I am interested more broadly in 
		how we can utilize modern tools to better understand plant evolution on a macroevolutionary scale, 
		specifically relating to the plant form. My work focuses on extinct & extant seed-free vascular plants. </p>
