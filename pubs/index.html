	<h1>Research</h1>
	<p>While my academic upbringing comes from the world of paleobotany, I am interested more broadly in 
		how we can utilize modern tools to better understand plant evolution on a macroevolutionary scale, 
		specifically relating to the plant form. My work focuses on extinct & extant seed-free vascular plants. </p>
	<h2>Zosterophyll systematics</h2>
	<p>Devonian floras illustrate the earliest radiations of vascular plant diversity, and how these morphologically simple plants laid the groundwork
		for the variation we see today. One group of these plants, the zosterophylls, are considered the earliest members of the lycophyte clade. 
		Despite their pivotal systematic position, relationships within the group as well as those with other Devonian plants remain murky. 
		For the completion of my master's thesis, I built a matrix aiming to evaluate relationships within the group with a special focus on 
		how the inclusion of anatomical characters
